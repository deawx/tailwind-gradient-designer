## Version 2 - Will be out soon

I've already started on version 2. Therefor the code in this repo looks a bit messy right now.

### Future possible features

- More space on screen to be used
- A complete new UI
- Will not use any PHP, just pure vanilla JS
- More like tool, less like a website
- Support for pseudo classes in code output
- Better preview - 3 preview modes, large, button on white and button on black
